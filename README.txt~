--------------------THE HYBRID MODEL FOR BOUNCING BALL IS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL IN THE REPORT.-----------------------------------

IN THIS HYBRID KALMAN FILTER IS USED TO PREDICT THE POSITION OF THE BOUNCING BALL

TRANSFORMATION OF STATES IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THIS TO REMOVE THE DISCONTINUITY FROM THE STATES SO THE GLUING TRANSFORM IS USED

1 FIRST OF ALL THE IMAGE FRAME IS CAPTURED FROM THE VIDEO.

2 THEN ON THR IMAGE HSV CONVERSION AND THRESHOLDING IS DONE.

3 TO GET PROPER BIN IMAGE WE USE ERODE AND DIALATE FUNCTIONS.

4 THEN CONTOUR FUNCTION IS USED TO RECOGNIZE THE BALL IN THR FRAME AND FIND ITS CENTROID.

5 THEN THESE CO-ORDINATES ARE USED BY THE KALMAN FILTER TO PREDICT THE POSITION OF THE BALL.

NOTE: - THE PROGRAM IS UNDER IMPROVEMENT AND DOES NOT GIVE 100% RESULTS
        AND THE FAULTY STEP MAY BE IN TAKING THE INVERSE OF THE TRANSFORMATION.
